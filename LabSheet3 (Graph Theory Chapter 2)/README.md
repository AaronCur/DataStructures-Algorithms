## Learning outcomes
At the end of this lab you should be able to:
-Explain the architecture of the Graph implementation (i.e. classes Graph, GraphNode,
GraphArc).
-Construct any directed graph using the Graph implementation.
-Implement the adapted breath first search algorithm as a member function of class Graph.
