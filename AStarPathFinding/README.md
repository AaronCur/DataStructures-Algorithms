## Learning outcomes
At the end of this lab you should be able to:
-Implement the Implement the A* algorithm. Should be added as a new memeber function 
to the Graph class 

### where:
-start is a Graph node indicating the origin of the search 
-dest is the goal vertex indicating the destination of the search
-std::function<void(Node *)> f_visit is a function that shows the node currently being expanded.
-path is a container (a vector) which holds the best path generated by the algorithm’s completion
