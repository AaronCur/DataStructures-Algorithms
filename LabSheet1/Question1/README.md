### Q1. 
Write a template function called scalarProduct() to compute the scalar (or dot) product
of two mathematical vectors. Each vector should be represented by an array, where x is stored in
index 0, y in index 1 and z in index 2. The scalar product is:
aobo + a1b1 + a2b2
The function should return the scalar product as a single value. Test your function with different
numeric types.
