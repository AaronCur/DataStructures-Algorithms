### Q3. Further to Q2, write another member function:
void remove(int index)
to remove the element at the specified index (hint: this means copying each array element one
place to the left from position index to the end of the array). If the array index is negative or >=
max. size of the array, the function should do nothing. Member variable m_numElements must be
updated as appropriate.
