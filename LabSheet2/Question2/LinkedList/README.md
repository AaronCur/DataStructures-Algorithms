### Q2. Add a new member function to the SLinkedList class with the following declaration:
void reverse()
This function should reverse the order of the list elements. For example, if the list contains the
sequence A, B, C then the reversed list will contain the sequence C, B, A.
Notes – as part of your solution:
1. You must not delete any list nodes.
2. Consider using a std::stack (think about how a stack may help here).
